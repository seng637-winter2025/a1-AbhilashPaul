# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

In this lab work, we will be performing 
- exploratory tests and scripted tests on the given ATM system v1.0.
- regression testing on the updated ATM system v1.1

Both programs are available inside the zip archive assignment1-artifacts.zip.
If we find any bug during exploratory/scripted testing, we will log it in a issue tracking system. We used Azure devops for the purpose of this assignment. The list of bugs is available at https://dev.azure.com/seng637-assignment1/assignment1/_workitems

Then, for each bug found, we performed regression testing on the updated version of the given system, and update its status in the Backlog.

Team had varying degree of familiarity with the types of testing performed for this assignment. Most of us were familiar with the concepts but did not have much practical experience.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

Most team members were familiar with these concepts theoretically but lacked extensive practical experience. Exploratory testing was understood as a creative process for uncovering unexpected issues without predefined scripts, while scripted manual functional testing was seen as a structured approach to validating specific functionalities against requirements. However, applying these techniques in a real-world scenario like this lab provided valuable hands-on experience in identifying bugs and assessing system behavior systematically. This lab work allowed us to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by exploring both structured (scripted) and unstructured (exploratory) approaches to software testing while reinforcing the importance of regression testing in ensuring bug fixes do not introduce new issues.
